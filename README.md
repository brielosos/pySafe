# pySafe
pySafe is a script that can encrypt/decrypt sensitive data to increase safety.

My suggestion is to keep the encrypted files online or on another device (like an usb stick) to avoid keeping the data and the key in the same place.
Pay attention on keeping a backup of the key to be safe, and remember that when you create a key, if there was already one saved its gonna overwrite it
